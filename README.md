In this project we had to create a bank landing page utilizing different elements such as Nav bars, hamburgers's for mobile, heros, footers, grid etc. 
This project helped me apply my theoretical knowledge practically. It was definitely challenging for me but the resources that I had access to helped me a lot. I think I did a pretty good job on this project and I am proud of it.
